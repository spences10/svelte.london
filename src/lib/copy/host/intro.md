# Host Svelte Society London

Since October 2019, Svelte Society London has been bringing together
developers of all experience levels for monthly meetups that combine
in-person connection with global reach. We're looking for companies to
host our community events and become part of London's dynamic Svelte
ecosystem.

Our events regularly attract 20-60 in-person attendees and 50-150 live
stream viewers, with recordings reaching thousands more through our
YouTube channel (17k+ subscribers).
