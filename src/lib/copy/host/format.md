## Event Format

We have settled on the following format for our events which allows
for attendees to socialise and network before the event starts.

### Typical Schedule

- 18:30-19:15: Arrival and networking
- 19:15: Live stream begins
- Company introduction and recruitment opportunity
- Two speakers (mix of in-person and remote)
- Interactive Q&A with both in-person and online audience
- Wrap up by 21:00

### Community Engagement

Our events are designed to maximize interaction and value for all
participants. Each session includes dedicated networking time,
allowing your team to connect naturally with attendees. The live
stream format extends your reach beyond the physical space, with
engaged viewers participating through chat and Q&A.
